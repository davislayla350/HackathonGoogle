#Hackathon Google Project

**🎉 Overview**

This is a retro-inspired simulation of the Google homepage, reimagined as it might have appeared during the early days of the internet in the late '90s or early 2000s. The project was created for Codedex's Holiday Hackathon as a solo effort.

This project uses modern web development tools to recreate a nostalgic experience while incorporating interactive elements and Easter eggs for users to explore.
